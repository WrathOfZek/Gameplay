# PvP implementation

- [ ] Player v. Player (PvP) combat can occur between any characters that are not on the same team, regardless of level. A level 50 character can attack and kill a level 6 character if that character is not a member of his alliance.
- [ ] Characters will be immune to PvP combat until they have gained enough strength to survive the struggle. Characters below 6th level are not able to participate in PvP combat. The first time a character zones after gaining 6th level he or she will then become PvP enabled.
- [ ] Characters will lose experience when killed in PvP combat if the character that killed them is within 5 levels. The amount of experience lost will be the same amount that is lost if that character is killed by an NPC. Your corpse can be resurrected by a cleric to partially restore lost experience.
- [ ] Characters will only be able to loot coins from other characters, and then only if the victim was within 5 levels of the killer. Only the character getting the killing blow will be able to loot the corpse.
- [ ] Combat skills' effective value is capped at 2 levels above a players current level.
- [ ] When a character iskilled in PvP combat if the character that killed them is within 5 levels an server-wide announcement will declare the winner

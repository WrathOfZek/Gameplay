# Wrath Of Zek - Edge of War (Custom Team PvP)

War is brewing across the continents, skirmishes between deity factions are a daily occurrence andÂ clandestine operations are commonplace. 

Wrath Of Zek is a deity based PvP Server divided into a Evil, Neutral and Good team. The server is set in Classic EverQuest, with some elements from Luclin, with a max level of 50. 

## Teams

Teams are based on Sullon Zek deity teams which restrict players from trading, grouping or guilding with other teams. Cross-teaming is not allowed and specific mechanics will be in place to try to restrict this. Cross-teaming will be a bannable offense. 

A trivial loot system based on threat generation and zone dominance will be implemented. Loot is also restricted to the team that killed the mob. 

There will be an IP restriction based on accounts tied to their team. An account will only be allowed to have 1 character.

## PvP

The server is a no level limit PvP environment with a PvP ladder to encourage fair play available in-game through PvP Stats Windows and Leaderboard. PvP is not restricted to the team divide but killing your own teammates will cost you PvP Points same as for griefing lower level players. 

The basis for the PvP points system can be found in the link below. The same goes for some of the balancing we will implement.

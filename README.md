# Wrath Of Zek - Edge of War (Custom Luclin Team PvP)

War is brewing across the continents, skirmishes between deity factions are a daily occurrence andÂ clandestine operations are commonplace. 

Wrath Of Zek is a deity based PvP Server divided into a Evil, Neutral and Good team. The server is set in Classic EverQuest, with some elements from Luclin, with a max level of 50. 

## Teams

Teams are based on Sullon Zek deity teams which restrict players from trading, grouping or guilding with other teams. Cross-teaming is not allowed and specific mechanics will be in place to try to restrict this. An trivial loot system based on threat generation and zone dominance will be implemented. Loot is also restricted to the team that killed the mob.

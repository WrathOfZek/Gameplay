# Wrath Of Zek - Edge of War (Custom Classic/Luclin Team PvP)

War is brewing across the continents, skirmishes between deity factions are a daily occurrence andÂ clandestine operations are commonplace. 

Wrath Of Zek is a deity based PvP Server divided into a Evil, Neutral and Good team. The server is set in Classic EverQuest, with some elements from Luclin, with a max level of 50. 

## Teams

Teams are based on Sullon Zek deity teams which restrict players from trading, grouping or guilding with other teams. 

A trivial loot system based on both hate generation and zone dominance is implemented to prevent cross-teaming.

## PvP

The server is a no level limit PvP environment with a PvP ladder to encourage fair play available in-game through PvP Stats Windows and Leaderboard. PvP is not restricted to the team divide.

## PvE 

Alternate Advancement Points, Disciplines and Leadership Points will be available to enhance gameplay. Content will be mostly original classical with some added items added through or moved to PvP vendors.
